      I have done no work since 3:00 AM on Thursday night. It feels kind of nice and a bit refreshing - it's given me a lot of time to think and a weekend like this could never
      exist in any other quarter I've had at UW so far. And I get to call you. :)<br><br>

      These are the things I've done since that night (morning?):<br><br>

      70 hours ago. Me and Max had our first meeting in 3 weeks. This conversation was our most extensive yet -
      it lasted nearly two hours. Which is probably only because Max just came back from Argentina.
      In these two weeks I did a bunch of work on a multiplicity of ideas and ended up with real results for
      the first time this quarter. I got really excited and proposed that we submit to EMNLP.
      Max says no. I think he wants a long paper, but really, iâ€™m just looking for a short -
      I just want something finished and published. Or just peer feedback. I think I want to talk to him again.
      I don't know, I just feel really unmotiviated like this.<br><br>

      68 hours ago. I met Kat and we got dinner with Richard and a few other friends.
      (Kat's my friend who left school for a quarter to do a spring internship at Google.)
      I think she's actually a good, comparassionate person, which I'm finding is getting
      harder and harder to find here at UW. She likes to get really excited when she finds
      a similarity with someone else, which is really entrataining to be around. She hates industry.
      She doesn't like feeling like a tool. Now she wants to become a teacher, to take an extra few quarters to teach before going full time
      for a few years. I respect it.<br><br>

      64 hours ago. I grab a drink with David. (David's my friend who is the astrology (?) major.) I try to figure out why
      he wants to go to grad school - partially to make conversation, partially because I might be unsure of my own reasons.
      He says that he never expected to make money, so the salary is nothing but a nice perk,
      and that the work in grad school is more fun. But why not change jobs? Why not find a job in another field? It's a 6
      year committment... maybe I just don't quite understand.<br><br>

      Saturday. I do nothing all day. I think I just feel really unmotiviated, or feel like there isn't something that I want to do. I wanted to do research
      because I have the EMNLP deadline in a few weeks. But without a submission there, it's really hard to feel like there's much reason to do anything else.
      The ML homework is a lot easier this week because people kept complaning about how hard the homework is. That class annoys me so much in general...
      no one pays attention in lecture, or even goes to lecture, and so many people complain about not understanding the concepts. Is every class like this?
      And the only reason why I notice it is because this is the only class where I'm passionate about the material? NLP wasn't like this. Maybe it's because
      the class is only juniors and sophomores. CS culture here is so annoying in general.<br><br>

      I think I thought about it more, and I know more about why I feel the way I do about the culture here and the people here.
      When I was a kid, I was always bullied for being the short asian kid with the weird skin. I was never really accepted, and the
      people who did seem to be my friends would always leave when it got inconvient. So I got to college, and I was really excited.
      It was a new start - college was supposed to be fun, the people were supposed to be nice, the expirence was supposed to be lifechanging.
      I wanted to have faith in people - on the first day of school, I walk around all eight floors of my dorm and knock on every door. I ask
      them to join me in my valiently naive quest for friends. There's a big group of us at the start - but after a couple weeks, people start
      to drift off. And after a few more months, even more people start to drift off. People start making new group chats and not inviting me to them.
      This happens again when I get in my major - and I join leadership to try and change the culture here. It doesn't work. So I intern
      in London to see it it's only a local thing. I think I'm just slowly starting to give up. I learned that there are really really good people out there,
      and there are people that I really really like and that I really get along with. But just that they're rare, and that I need to treasure them, because they're
      really hard to find.<br><br>

      10 hours ago. I see Avengers with my 2020 roommates. (Jihoon, who is the guy who sat next to me in a math lecture freshman year, is here).
      It was a pretty good movie, but our conversation was so dry. Gavin was constantly acting like he was better than us - he would purposely walk faster than us,
      he would jaywalk ever streetlight and stare at us from the other side, he would smerk at us whenever we said anything. I think he's starting to get on my nerves again.
      I think he's just really ungrateful and he thinks that his life sucks. In reality, though, maybe a lot of people are like that. Or just a lot of people who seem to be around me are
      like that.<br><br>

      I love you, Meha. Sorry for being so cranky this weekend. I'll see you in 13 days.<br><br>
