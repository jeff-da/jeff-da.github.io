         <h3>ACM Research Night</h3>
         <p />
         <p>Welcome to ACM research night. Following is the list of speakers, in no particular order. It's expected that most people will stay ~30 minutes after the presentations to talk to the speakers that interest them.</p>

         <h5>Jeff Da, xlab (NLP). jzda@cs.washington.edu</h5>
         <p>Visual reasoning between real images and text. For more details about the specific project, check out http://lic.nlp.cornell.edu/nlvr/.</p>
         <h5>Nikita Haduong, CV and NLP. qu@cs.washington.edu</h5>
         <p>Mobile Language Learning Game, [GRAIL/Vision lab advisors] Steve Seitz, Zoran Popovic, Ali Farhadi, [NLP advisor] Noah Smith.
          Imagine a cross between Pokemon Go and Animal Crossing that can help you learn a foreign language. By exploring your physical environment and encountering and developing your relationship with the language that surrounds you, will you learn a new language?
          Looking for: (Tentative) Summer, Fall
          Skills: Unity/C#, familiar with games and what makes games fun, interested in education</p>
         <h5>Vinitha Ranganeni, RSE and HCR. vinitha@cs.washington.edu</h5>
         <p>Robot manipulators can use different cleaning tools to manipulate and remove dirt and stains on surfaces. Learning to clean requires simultaneously modelling how the state of dirt/stains change in response to robot tool actions (i.e. learning the world dynamics in a large state/action space) as well as what the task is from a combination of exploration, human demonstration, and evaluative feedback (e.g. positive rewards received for reducing a stain or successfully bringing dirt to a dustbin, or negative rewards for dropping dirt on the floor). In this project we model curiosity-driven exploration in two ways: (1) given a particular task (environment and target dirt configuration), the robot explores using different models of curiosity (e.g. maximizing novel information, maximizing performance on anticipated future tasks) to learn world dynamics and a policy to accomplish the task; and (2) in the absence of user-suggested tasks, automatically generate new tasks to practice in.</p>
         <h5>Josh Gardner, Center for Game Science. jpgard@cs.washington.edu</h5>
         <p>Seeking a summer research intern to complete the development, experimental evaluation, and deployment of deep learning-based features for the Mozak neuronal reconstruction game (https://mozak.science). The goal of this project is to build an intelligent AI-driven feature which automatically generates "contrasting cases" hints from previously-observed data to support users as they solve problems. This would involve a considerable software engineering component in Python. Applicants should be experienced in Python, deep learning (Keras/TensorFlow), data visualization, git, and basic web services concepts (e.g. JSON, web APIs). Possibility for extension into additional research projects in 2019-2020, as well as for ML-related publication(s) based on this work.
         </p>
         <h5>Zhen Zhang, PLSE (software engineering). zgzhen@cs.washington.edu</h5>
         <p>SeGuard is a new, on-going project aiming at applying machine learning on highly abstract, semantic-rich program representations for malware classification purpose. This is a joint work between UW, UCSB and Google.

         <h5>Eric Zeng, Security and Privacy Lab. ericzeng@cs.washington.edu</h5>
         <p>The Security and Privacy Lab keeps its finger on the pulse of emerging and future technologies and conducts rigorous, scientific studies of the security and privacy risks inherent in those technologies before adversaries manifest. In this talk I'll discuss how we measure and evaluate the security and privacy of smart homes, web tracking, and augmented reality. </p>
         <h5>William Agnew, MI/AI and Robotics. wagnew3@cs.washington.edu</h5>
         <p>Sidd's robotics lab is looking for undergraduate researchers for summer and fall 2019. We conduct research in robotic planning, hardware, human robot interaction, reinforcement learning, and more. Please send a resume/CV and statement of interest to wagnew3@cs.washington.edu and mbarnes@cs.washington.edu to be considered. Experience in python, tensorflow, pytorch, ROS, C/C++, openAI gym and classes in statistics, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and robotics are pluses, but we are willing to help strong applicants learn the necessary skills.</p>
